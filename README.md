# BattleSalvo - AI Player (Programming Assignment for CS3500, Object-Oriented Design)

This project was an assignment for CS3500. After building the base game (with functionality just for a single player against random shots), our next iteration of the project required server communication and improved computer players. When running the attached server.jar, and providing the driver appropriate command-line input for running a networked game, output shows the moves that the A.I. player designed (in DecisionMaker, OpponentBoardTracker, etc.) makes.
